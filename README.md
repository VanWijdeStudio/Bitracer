Bitracer is a top down, 2d, pixel art racing game meant to be simple arcade style fun.
This repo provides a basic version of the game, using this you are allowed to create mods for the actual game.
these mods can include anything from cars, tracks, ui systems to entire new physics to make it more of a simulator style game.

You are free to distribute the mods you create, paid or free, as long as you dont package the game with it.
